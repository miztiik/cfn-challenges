# Instance Connectivity Without Key-Pair

## 🔥 Scenario

Mystique Unicorn App Security Board had been recently formed to improve the security of this fast growing mobile app. During the first security audit, It was observed that all the application teams are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, which is the latest version available on the marketplace, But the instances are running with permanent SSH keys. In accordance with new security board recommendations `SSH` keys should not be used on a permanent basis. The teams would like to continue with the same operating system but also want to comply with new recommendations.

One of the Ops Engineer, after watching a [Miztiik demo][1] in youtube came up an idea of replacing the hard-coded ssh keys using AWS native tooling. If you were the Ops Engineer, Can you come up with the same or similar solution without referring to outside help.

To help you get started, here is the half written template by that Ops Engineer, This template creates an EC2 instance without a SSH Key Pair. Your task is to establish _SSH terminal_ connectivity to the server but without adding SSH Keys(aka Key-Pair)
