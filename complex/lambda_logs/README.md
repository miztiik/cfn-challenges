# Lambda Logging Errors

## üî• Scenario

The engineer is attempting to achieve the following,

- The lambda runtime is `Python`
- AWS Lambda Function code is embedded in cloudformation using the [ZipFile][1] method.
- Upon succesful execution, the logs **should** appear in AWS CloudWatch Logs.
  - Setup your own sample event

_There are atleast 5 fixes to be made. Good Luck_
