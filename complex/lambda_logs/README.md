# Lambda Logging Errors

## üî• Scenario

Mystique Unicorn App is using AWS Lambda for their microservices. One of their hot-shot engineer is new AWS Lambda especially provisioning them with AWS Cloudformation. Can you help?

The engineer is attempting to achieve the following,

- The lambda runtime is `Python`
- AWS Lambda Function code is embedded in cloudformation using the [ZipFile][1] method.
- Upon succesful execution, the logs **should** appear in AWS CloudWatch Logs.
  - Setup your own sample event

_There are atleast 5 fixes to be made. Good Luck_

<sup>Hint: [Refer][2]</sup>

## Who is using this

A number of organisations are using gamification to enhance their team skills. This Udemy [course][100] uses this repository extensively to teach cloudformation to new beginners in AWS.
