# Private Web Servers

## 🔥 Scenario

Your friend _Miztiik_ is setting up an internal application to be used by the app-dev team. This template is creating the instance in the private subnet. During the security audit, it was found out that the private instances are also having a public ip attached.

Can you fix it?
