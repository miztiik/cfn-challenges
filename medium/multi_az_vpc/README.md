# VPC Across Multiple Availability Zones

## 🔥 Scenario

- Create the VPC using this template.
- Launch one EC2 instance on the `PrivateSubnet` (_You will need to create your own EC2, This template does not launch the instance_)
  - This EC2 instance **should** to connect to the internet for getting updates, dependant libraries etc.,

Unfortuntely, the EC2 instance is unable to connect to the internet. Can you help?
