# Security Audit & Compliance for AWS API Calls

## 🔥 Scenario

Your company policy mandates all API call be logged in a secure manner. This will enable applications to be compliant with government and industry regulations. As part of this compliance setup, _Miztiik_ is setting up _AWS CloudTrail_ in your company account. The current template does not seem to work, while it worked in the past with other older accounts.

Can you fix the issues with the template and setup cloudtrail?
