# Production Data Security

## 🔥 Scenario

Your friend _Miztiik_ working at 'Mystique Unicorn App' is setting up a data lake in AWS using S3. The data lake will be setup in multiple environments hosting business crtical data. _Miztiik_ intends to encrypt the data, if the environment is `production`. Unfortunately, the current template is not setting up the encryption on the bucket.

Can you help?
