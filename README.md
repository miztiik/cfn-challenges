    **NOTE**: These templates have been tested in `us-east-1` region. It is highly recommended to try them out them in the same region.

    ```bash
    # Configure AWS CLI
    aws configure

    # Deploy the template
    aws cloudformation create-stack \
        --stack-name "miztiik-automation-clouformation-challenge-puzzles" \
        --template-body file://parameterize_ddb.json \
        --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
    ```

1. ## 🔬 Solving the puzzle

    Depending upon the puzzle, you may have to do one or some of these tasks to solve them.

    - Check if, _ALL_ resources that are required are deployed.
    - Check if, _ALL_ attributes for resources have been set correctly.
        - For examples, Check if S3 bucket is having `versioning` or `encryption` etc.,
    - Check if the resources are communicating with each other,
        - For example, Is the Webserver accessible from public IP?

    Good Luck

1. ## 🧹 CleanUp

    If you want to destroy all the resources created by the stack, Execute the below command to delete the stack, or _you can delete the stack from console as well_

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack \
        --stack-name "miztiik-automation-clouformation-challenge-puzzles"
    ```
