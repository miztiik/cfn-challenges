    Here is a sample CLI command to deploy the template. Make your you have downloaded the template `parameterize_ddb.json` and run this command from the same directory.

    **NOTE**: These templates have been tested in `us-east-1` region. It is highly recommended to try them out them in the same region.

    ```bash
    # Configure AWS CLI
    aws configure

    # Deploy the template
    aws cloudformation create-stack \
        --stack-name "miztiik-automation-clouformation-challenge-puzzles" \
        --template-body file://REPLACE-WITH-TEMPLATE-FILE-NAME \
        --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
    ```

1. ## üî¨ Solving the puzzle

    Depending upon the puzzle, you may have to do one or some of these tasks to solve them.

    - Check if, _ALL_ resources that are required are deployed.
    - Check if, _ALL_ attributes for resources have been set correctly.
        - For example, Check if S3 bucket is having `versioning` or `encryption` etc.,
    - Check if the resources are communicating with each other,
        - For example, Is the Webserver accessible from public IP?

    Good Luck

1. ## üßπ CleanUp

    *You* are responsible for the resources being created by any of the templates in this repository. You are encouraged to destroy all the resources after their purpose has been met. One of the way to clean up the resources is to execute the below command to delete the stack, or _you can delete the stack from console as well_

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack \
        --stack-name "miztiik-automation-cloudformation-challenge-puzzles"
    ```

    This is not an exhaustive list, please carry out other necessary steps as maybe applicable to your needs.
